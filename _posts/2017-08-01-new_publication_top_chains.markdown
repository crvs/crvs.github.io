I put out a new paper preprint available [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/3151/). the paper "An algorithm for calculating top-dimensional bounding chains" deals with solving the system $\partial c = p$ where $p$ is a cycle of dimension $n-1$ on a simplicial complex of dimension $n$.

An implementation of the algorithm is available in [my github repository](https://github.com/crvs/coeff-flow).
