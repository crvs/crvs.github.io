Finally, the paper [An algorithm for calculating top-dimensional bounding chains"]( {{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/2017-08-17-coeff-flow.markdown %}) has been made available in PeerJ, and the final version can be obtained from their webpage [here](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-153/?td=bl). So this is probably the last time I am bringing this paper up.
