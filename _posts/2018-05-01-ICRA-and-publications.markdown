I will be attending ICRA 2018 in Brisbane, Australia where I will be presenting the paper [Path Clustering with Homology Area]({{ "_publications/2017-09-15-homology-clustering-pub.markdown" | absolute_url }}).

On a (not so) related note, the paper [An algorithm for calculating top-dimensional bounding chains"]( {{ "_publications/2017-08-17-coeff-flow.markdown" | absolute_url }}) has been accepted for publication in [PeerJ-CS](https://peerj.com/computer-science/).

Also related is the fact that I have included a [new project]( {{ "_projects/homology_clustering.markdown" | absolute_url }}) on the web page that is related to the paper I will present on ICRA 2018.
