I will be attending ICRA 2018 in Brisbane, Australia where I will be presenting the paper [Path Clustering with Homology Area]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link _publications/2017-09-15-homology-clustering-pub.markdown %}).

On a (not so) related note, the paper [An algorithm for calculating top-dimensional bounding chains"]( {{ "/publications/2017-08-17-coeff-flow.html" | relative_url }}) has been accepted for publication in [PeerJ-CS](https://peerj.com/computer-science/).

klso related is the fact that I have included a [new project]( {{ "projects/homology_clustering.html" | relative_url }}) on the web page that is related to the paper I will present on ICRA 2018.
