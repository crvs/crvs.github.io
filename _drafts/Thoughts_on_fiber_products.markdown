So I decided to read the entirety of Serge Lang's "Introduction to Differential Geometry" until such a point where I am comfortable with basically anything that can be considered classical differential geometry, so maybe skipping more exoteric things in the end that are bound to happen. And then I came up to *transversality* which I still remembered from my cours e in differential topology some years back, and in the midst of this discussion he (as he often does) goes into the category theroetical meaning of transversality. And this is where my interest spiked.

TL;DR: I'm gonna talk about transversality and pull-backs.

Starting with the basics, he says that two maps are transversal if and only if $T_{f(x)}(Im(f)) + Im(T_)$
