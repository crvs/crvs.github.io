I am a PhD student at the [Robotics Perception and Learning Lab (RPL)](www.kth.se/rpl) in the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.

My research interests include (but are not limited to):

- Category Theory
- Computational algebraic geometry
- Computational algebraic topology
- Applications of geometry and topology to computer science, robotics and learning
- Functional programming

My thesis work has been in the area of path clustering using tools from algebraic topology.
