Abstract. In this paper, we present an approach towards approximating configuration spaces of 2D and 3D rigid objects. The approximation can be used to identify caging configurations and establish path non-existence between given pairs of configurations. We prove correctness and analyse completeness of our approach. Using dual diagrams of unions of balls and uniform grids on SO(3), we provide a way to approximate a 6D configuration space of a rigid object. Depending on the desired level of guaranteed approximation accuracy, the experiments with our single core implementation show runtime between 5--21 s. and 463--1558 s.  Finally, we establish a connection between robotic caging and molecular caging from organic chemistry, and demonstrate that our approach is applicable to 3D molecular models.
